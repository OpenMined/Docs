## Step 2: OpenMined Introduction

This video covers the platform as a whole including high level goals and the broad architecture strategies (the big moving parts!).

## Step 3: Syft Installation + Homomorphic Encryption Demo

Once you've got a general understanding of the platform, you'll want to start with the basics, getting Homomorphic Encryption up and running within PySyft.

- [First, install PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/)
- [Second, test this notebook](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/blob/master/notebooks/Syft%20-%20Paillier%20Homomorphic%20Encryption%20Example.ipynb)

## Step 4: Homomorphically Encrypted Linear Classifier Demo

[Complete this Notebook](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/blob/master/notebooks/Syft%20-%20Paillier%20Encrypted%20Linear%20Classification.ipynb)

## Step 5: Install Sonar, PySonar, and Demo

- [Install Sonar](https://github.com/OpenMined/Sonar)
- [Install PySonar](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySonar)
- Demo: Encrypted Neural Network on Test Ethereum Blockchain
  - https://github.com/OpenMined/PySonar/blob/master/notebooks/Sonar%20-%20Decentralized%20Model%20Training%20Simulation%20(local%20blockchain).ipynb

## Step 6: Install Zenhub Plugin

In order to see our documentation and issues in all their full glory, you'll want to install this browser plugin for Zenhub. Just navigate to http://zenhub.com and click the "Add ZenHub to GitHub" button.

## Step 7: Join the Slack channels and chat with the teams

When in doubt, ask away in these Slack channels, don't hesitate!

- `#team_capsule` : Capsule project - if you're interested in cryptography
- `#team_devops` : Operations - if you're interested in Docker, Continuous Integration and operations
- `#team_docs` : Documentation - if you're interested in helping us make this project easier to understand
- `#team_marketing` : Marketing & Branding - perception, visuals, messaging, communication, campaigns, goals of the OpenMined project
- `#team_mine` : Mine project - if you're interested in user data
- `#team_sonar` : Sonar project - if you're interested in blockchain, incentives, cryptography, distributed file storage (IPFS)
- `#team_syft` : Syft project - if you're interested in cryptography and deep learning (machine learning)
- `#process` : Process - discuss how we do things around here and how we can improve
- `#code` : Code changes - get a feed on what people are actively working on - issues and pull requests
- `#beginner` : If you don't know where to start on something, ask away ðŸ™‚
- `#announcements` : Read-only channel where project leads make announcements
- `#terminology` : If you don't know what a name means, ask here
- `#questions` : For general Q&A
- `#general-discussion` : If you have a question that doesn't fit into any of the above, ask here!

## Step 8: Congratulations You're Ready!

You now have the basics of the OpenMined ecosystem up and running and are ready to take on `beginner` level projects (Issues). We've gone out of our way to make sure that there are a plethora of mini-projects (Issues) that are 100% entry level. The way to find one is to pick any GitHub repository and click the *Issues* Tab at the top. This should take you to a place that looks like this.

![Issues.png](https://github.com/OpenMined/Docs/raw/master/img/issues.png)


Next, you click "Labels -> beginner".


Or, click on this link:
[Labels -> beginner](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abeginner).


This will filter out all tickets except for the `beginner` tickets.


Click one of the tickets and you'll see something like this:

![https://github.com/OpenMined/Docs/raw/master/img/beginner_ticket.png](https://github.com/OpenMined/Docs/raw/master/img/beginner_ticket.png)

This ticket contains instructions for how to add a subtraction function to our Base Tensor object, with links to further documentation to help explain everything the ticket should do. If you have ANY questions about a ticket, simply message the person who created the ticket (in the ticket above, that's @trask on Slack)

Before beginning work, make sure to be aware of our [contributing guidelines](./guidelines.md).

Once your first Pull Request is merged into an OpenMined repository, you'll get your official invite to become a *Member of the Github Organization*!
