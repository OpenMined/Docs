# Label Definitions

* `Epic`: Big issue to be broken down into smaller tasks

### Priority
* `high priority`: To be handled as soon as possible, usually a bug or security loophole

### Difficulty
* `first PR`: Easy pickings for new contributors to dive right in!
* `beginner`: Relatively low effort/not much domain knowledge required

Feel free to tackle the unlabeled issues after you have handled a beginner issue or two!
