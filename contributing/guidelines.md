# Contributing

Welcome! If you have not yet, checkout the [quickstart guide](./quickstart.md). The rest of this is for when you are starting to contribute code. The goal is to make contributing to the project as seemless as possible for _everyone_ by being on the same page. If you have any suggestions for rules, follow the [filing an issue guidelines](#step-1-file--claim-an-issue)

In all places, whether commenting, filing an issue, or writing documentation, follow [docker's documentation and style conventions](https://docs.docker.com/opensource/doc-style/)

## How to Contribute

### Step 1: File / Claim an Issue
- Give notification that you are working on an existing issue or file a new one with notification.
- Issues or comments on existing issues should be related to OpenMined.
- Issue titles should be concise yet descriptive.<br>
  **Example** Instead of `Newbie question, please help`, use `How do I set up git to ignore test files?`

- Phrasing should match the main purpose of the issue.<br>
  For example, if it is a bug report, the issue title should sound like a bug report
  **Example** `Option 'other' is missing from the dropdown` instead of a feature request `Add 'other' option to the dropdown`.

### Step 2: Branch (and maybe fork)

For the most part, we follow [git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), with the exception of a few additional rules:

- If you have not contributed, fork and branch from there.
- Branch names have the following tags:
    - üêõ `bug`- fixing bugs in existing code
    - üëñ `chore`- updating tooling or cleanup
    - üìö `docs`- adding/updating docs
    - ‚ûï `feature` - adding new features, work on a feature
    - üîß `tool` - adding modules/tools, development candy


- Branch names follow the following structure:
     - `<tag>/<feature name>--<branch changes>`

        **Example** `feature/he--key-rotation-add` or `chore/webpack--update-to-2`

- `master` on all repos stay protected, branch from there


### Step 3: Do work and commit

- One commit per logical change
- Be descriptive (no `Update README.md`)
- Do not make unnecessary changes to the codebase (e.g. adding/removing newlines) or changes unrelated to the issue the pull request is meant to address (please open a separate PR!)
- [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) is a wonderful tool that helps keep commits organized. If you are frequently contributing, we highly recommend using it.

### Step 4: Pull Request
- Open a pull request against `master` and request a review. All code must meet [code standards](#code), pass integration tests, and provide a meaningful contribution.
- Tag the issues that the pull request addresses by including a GitHub keyword in the description (e.g. `Closes #1`)
- Be respectful to the reviewer! We are all trying to improve OpenMined üìà
- Once your Pull Request has been accepted, you are officially a contributor! üî•üí•üéÜüéâ


## Code

You are writing code for people to read just as much as machines. Be purposeful! [Language specific conventions](./languages.md) supersede these rules.

### Filenames

Unless a specific language convention states otherwise, all file names should be lower case and hyphenated.
**Example** `this-is-a-name.js`

### Variable Naming

Naming is not an exact science, but following these principals will help.

-  **Booleans**: Prefix with `is`, `has`
- Prioritize **descriptive** names over brevity (avoid names like `a`, `b`, `x`, etc).


### Comments

_Your code should tell the story of what you are doing; your comments should tell the story of why you are doing it._ (Source: http://stackoverflow.com/a/142869)

- Use the following prefixes when commenting:
  - `// TODO` if there is still a meaningful task to be done
  - `// FIXME` if there is something that needs to be fixed before merging
  - `// HACK` if you know or believe there is a better implementation

- Do not repeat what the code is already telling you

## Documentation

Unless it is specific to development of a repo, put any documentation in the [Docs](https://github.com/OpenMined/Docs) repo. You are in that now!

For repository specific documentation please stick to the [Readme template](readme_template.md). All repos following this standard set of _required topics_ covered in the readme enable an aligned developer experience when browsing multiple repositories.
