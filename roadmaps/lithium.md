### Lithium üîã

**Theme:** Distributed OpenMined platform for _tweet content_ ‚û°Ô∏è ¬†_hashtag prediction_

**Goals:**
* use a public blockchain to enable multi-user proof of concept phase
* support `diabetes` and personal `twitter` data in the mine/Sonar
* basic NLP support in `pySonar`

**Assumptions:**
* `pySonar` features might be tailored towards this use case
* a user in the network might not own twitter data (diabetes dummy comes with the mine)
* there are no dynamic rules in the training priority

**Acceptance Criteria:**
_MISSING_
