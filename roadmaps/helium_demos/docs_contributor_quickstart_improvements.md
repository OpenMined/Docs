# Helium : Contributor Quickstart Improvements

<b>Background:</b> The growth of the OpenMined Community is directly related to the ease by which new contributors can transition from the first time they hear about us (somewhere on the internet) to the first time they make a Pull Request. In this statement of work, we want to plan the kinds of improvements we want to see in our process for attracting and onboarding talent.

### Part 1: User Stories

(dummy stories below)
* <b>User Story A:</b> As an <X> enthusiast, I want to hear about OpenMined in one of my Ethereum Communities in such a way that I land on a page of the project that cators to my interests, explains why I might be interested in the project, and leads me through a curriculum of information that takes me through my first Pull Request in the appropriate Repository. The curriculum should both serve as a means of conveying information, but it should also keep me engaged and grow my excitement around what the OpenMined Community is building.

<X> could be any one of the following:
- Ethereum -> Team Sonar
- Deep Learning -> Team Syft
- Homomorphic Encryption -> Team Syft
- Node.js -> Team Mine
- others?
