# Helium : OpenMined on Tendermint

<b>Background:</b> Everything we do with Ethereum, we want to do on Tendermint for 20x the speed. This project is about building the 2 big demos from Hydrogen (A notebook and a docker one-liner) to use Ethermint instead of Ethereum as the underlying blockchain.

### Part 1: User Stories

* <b>User Story A:</b> As a user of our Docker One-Liner to run the entire OpenMined Platform, I want the ability to instead have a one-liner which downloads a docker image running the OpenMined platform on the Ethermint Tendermint blockchain.
* <b>User Story B:</b> As a developer of OpenMined, I want the ability to spin up Sonar and PySonar on Tendermint using the Ethermint platform (not using Docker... just by running it locally)

### Part 2: Acceptance Criteria

[PySonar: Epic - OpenMined on Tendermint](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySonar/issues/40)
  - [Issue 44](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySonar/issues/41) - Docker One-Liner on Tendermint (Ethermint)
  - [Issue 45](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySonar/issues/42) - PySonar Notebook runnable on Tendermint (from scratch deps)
