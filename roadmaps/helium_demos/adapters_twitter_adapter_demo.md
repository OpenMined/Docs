# Helium : Twitter Adapter Demo

<b>Background:</b> We want to prototype an initial piece of functionality wherein users can download data from their public twitter profiles and automatically load it into a mine that they host.

### Part 1: User Stories

(dummy stories below)
* <b>User Story A:</b> As a Miner in the OpenMined ecosystem, I want a basic Adapters UI with a first adapter loaded into it. This adapter should give me the ability to download my PUBLIC twitter information into my mine.js datamine.
* <b>User Story B:</b> As a Developer in the OpenMined ecosystem, I want the ability to programmatically build an Adapter that is compatible with a more general Adapter spec for the OpenMined platform... such that it could be trivially loaded into the initial Adapter UI.
### Part 2: Acceptance Criteria
