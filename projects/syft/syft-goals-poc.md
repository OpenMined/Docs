# Goals of Syft `Proof of Concept`
1. As a `Data Scientist`, I want to be able to create Homomorphically Encrypted Neural Networks so that I can train my `Models` in the `Mines` without fear of theft.

# Features required to accomplish Goals
1. `Must have` a Generic Tensor type class, to be used as the basic building block of all Syft neural networks.
1. Tensors `must have` support for Fixed Point Precision.
1. `Must be able` to perform Addition and Multiplication with Tensors.
1. `Must have` the most commonly used neural network layer.
1. `Must have` the most commonly used nonlinear function.
1. `Must have` the most commonly used loss function.

1.`Must have` a benchmarking suite for all operations and encryptions
1.`Must have` a test suite for all features.
